	<i align="center">Buni Shape n' Surf exists as the all-in-one suite for Surfboard Builders. Users are able to select and save surf spots around the world through the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps">Google Maps API</a>, then either view a real-time surf forecast, lookahead into the upcoming month, or view the last year's worth of surf data—all through the <a href="https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/marine-weather-api">Open-Meteo Marine Weather API</a>. For the surfboard shaping side of the application, if a user finds a surfboard they would like to recreate they can visit the "Shape Board" page where they can either take a picture of a board or upload it from their phone. A <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> Lite Machine Learning Model was trained by our team for surfboard image recognition. If it really was a board that the user took a picture of, the user can then enter the size of the board they would like. Our <a href=https://opencv.org/>OpenCV</a> implementation finds the outline of the board, splits it in half, and divides it into slices that fit on a standard 8.5"x11" piece of paper. From there, the user can save the board and print the pdf generated by <a href = "https://itextpdf.com/"> ITextPdf</a>. Just like that, the user is ready to make a surfboard!
